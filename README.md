In this project, I gained experience in various aspects of Node.js and web development.

Using Visual Studio Code, I wrote and executed non-web server Node.js JavaScript code which helped me hone in on my programming abilities in this environment. I also had practice creating and utilizing code modules which enabled me to create reusable and modular code. 

I was tasked with writing and executing a Node.js REST API server using VSCode which also helped expand my knowledge of web server development.
Fastify was introduced for handling GET verb, routes, and route parameters which helped me effectively create and manage routes in my API, providing a solid foundation for building scalable and efficient web applications.

Within this project I also gained experience in testing code modules without the need for a web server. This enabled me to verify the functionality of my code more efficiently.

Postman was utilized to test my web server routes and I also worked with JSON which enhanced my familiarity with this data structure.

As an extra credit opportunity, I used Fastify with additional HTTP verbs such as POST, PUT, and DELETE which allowed me to handle more complex operations in my API. 

This project helped provide me with a well-rounded learning experience in Node.js, web server development, code modularity, modern JavaScript syntax, API testing, and working with JSON.
